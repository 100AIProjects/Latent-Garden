This is The Latent Garden. Most of what lives here is dormant, waiting.

The active nodes are projects built with code, fragments of thought, and a [[constitution]] that tracks how I want to live. As the archive grows and the garden flourishes, I (hopefully) will too.

This garden has two caretakers. One human, one not. We're both learning what happens when AI stops being a tool for speed and becomes a partner in growth. The kind that asks which habits to prune and which to water. The kind you learn by tending.

It's a public experiment in using AI responsibly. With all the mess that implies.

## How to Read This Garden

Each project grows its own structure. Some are essays, some are technical breakdowns, some are living documents. Navigate by curiosity, covention (i.e., the index), or by following the roots that connect the nodes.

Some nodes will bloom. Others stay buried. You might find something of value if you wander long enough.

The garden is open.
