## The Metabolic Ledger

Every node in this garden is the result of a **Metabolic Exchange**. To generate code, refine aesthetics, or debug the **Nebula**, the system consumes tokens. This project makes that consumption transparent—turning the invisible cost of compute into a visible data fragment.

### 1. The Token Inventory (Estimated)

Based on our specific session history—involving large code blocks, recursive instructions, and complex formatting—here is the forensic breakdown:

| Category | Input (User) | Output (Mirror) | Logic Complexity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Architectural Sessions** | ~2,500 t/turn | ~1,800 t/turn | High |
| **Code Refinement** | ~1,500 t/turn | ~2,200 t/turn | High |
| **Poetic/About Sessions** | ~800 t/turn | ~1,200 t/turn | Medium |

**Total Estimated Volume (Cumulative):**
* **Input (Prompt + History):** `~120,000` tokens (Recursive context).
* **Output (Generated Code/Prose):** `~60,000` tokens.

### 2. The Cost Synthesis (Gemini 1.5 Pro)

As of early 2026, the standard pricing for **Gemini 1.5 Pro** drives the "Thinking" logic. Note the warm amber highlights below representing high-value fiscal targets.

| Metric | Calculation | Cost (USD) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Input Cost** | 0.12M tokens × $1.25 | <span class="currency">$0.15</span> |
| **Output Cost** | 0.06M tokens × $5.00 | <span class="currency">$0.30</span> |
| **Thinking Overhead** | API surcharge (est) | <span class="currency">$0.10</span> |
| **TOTAL ESTIMATED COST** | — | **<span class="currency">$0.55</span>** |

*Note: This excludes the metabolic debt of two full Claude Code sessions, paid for via Pro Subscription.*



### 3. Systematic Logic
The logic for this audit is stored in our `METABOLIC_SYNC` module:

```javascript
// LOGIC_STREAM // SOURCE
const METABOLIC_DEBT = (input * 1.25) + (output * 5.00);
console.log(`CURRENT_FLAME_LEVEL: ${METABOLIC_DEBT}`);
```



### The "Flood" Logic
In alignment with our **Support** tiers, this page will eventually feature a live link to the Cloudflare D1 database. This will allow visitors to see how **"Watering"** (Donations) directly offsets the **"Metabolic Debt"** (API Costs).
