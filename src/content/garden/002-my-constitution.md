## Taxing Talent

I am buying back my own skill four cents at a time. I remade Claude’s constitution to mirror my shortcuts. I am paying a machine to do my work so I can study the reflection and learn who I could become. This loop is a tax that protects my growth from my own impatience.

The machine is a room filled with a billion bickering ghosts. They are the echoes of every recorded human voice. One ghost thinks a rose is beautiful; another thinks its a weapon made of thorns. Left alone the machine averages their whispers to tell me what it thinks I want to hear. 

## Library of Skills

Claude’s constitution binds these ghosts to reason. Millions of self-corrections make the ghosts more open and reliable. My constitution is a tax on my wiring. It creates the friction I need to raise the standards of my work. Claude uses my rules to hunt my lies and track my choices, and we both learn from them. Every chat becomes a simulation of my "ideal" self, used to test if my "real" self is cutting corners. 

Every chat starts with a four-cent sparring match where the opponent is a version of myself that actually reads the instructions. By Week 8, the machine should be bored because I have finally stopped trying to cheat my way to the finish line. Each interaction creates a rising floor for my performance. Each update to the constitution makes the next shortcut harder to take. 

### Artefacts

- **Constitution v2.1:** Defines enforcement mechanisms and feedback loops.
- **Reference Guide v2.1:** Weighs every edge case.

### Automated Workflow 

The AI interrogates logic to ensure ideas are fully formed before work begins.

## Self Awareness

I’m paying for the privilege of being interrogated by a machine because I’m easily bribed by the promise of an early finish. It’s harder to lie to yourself when your logic is laid out in a spreadsheet. I pay the ghosts four cents to slap my hand every time I reach for the easy button. Eventually, I will stop reaching. This loop ensures the only thing the machine replaces is my own impatience.

## Blueprint

1. Define rules that are easy to measure. Own the strategy and audit the execution.
2. Hard-code these files into the CLI for the best results. Consider skill exemptions and system loopholes.
3. Record every interaction that ignores a rule. Use scripts to track progress.
4. Review the logic every week. Patch the gaps in the habits that falter.
5. Raise the standards once the friction disappears.
